Fanlens Web/REST tier / Microservices.

Based on customized Flask in connection with connexion.
API first driven via the respective swagger YMLs.

Houses the UI layer:
* Landing page
* Emails and Enquiries
* Login flow
 * Session/HTTP Token based
 * Twitter Signin
 * User info and JWT creation for API interaction
* Single page Fanlens app

and the API layer:
* Interaction with the "activities" and its meta data (e.g. Facebook data)
* Interaction with the prediction engine via "model"

To interact with the API layer one needs to first "exchange" an HTTP login token (or a logged in session) for a JWT,
i.e. call the /{version}/user or /{version}/user/jwt endpoint. The JWT is valid for 1 hour.
Both a login token and a JWT are transmitted via the "Authorization" Header.

The different layers can be run via a dev server which monitors file changes using `python -mui` or `python -mapi`.
